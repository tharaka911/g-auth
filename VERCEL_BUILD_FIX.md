# Vercel Build Issue - TailwindCSS v4 Resolution

## Problem Summary
Vercel build was failing with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/postcss'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by TailwindCSS v4 version resolution problems in Vercel's build environment:

1. **Version Range Issues**: Package.json used `^4` which allowed different versions between local and Vercel
2. **PostCSS Configuration**: Plugin configuration was using array format instead of object format
3. **Missing Configuration**: No explicit TailwindCSS configuration file for Vercel compatibility

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Locked Exact TailwindCSS Versions
**File**: `package.json`
```diff
- "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4",
- "tailwindcss": "^4",
+ "@tailwindcss/postcss": "4.1.8",
+ "tailwindcss": "4.1.8",
```

### 2. Updated PostCSS Configuration
**File**: `postcss.config.mjs`
```diff
- const config = {
-   plugins: ["@tailwindcss/postcss"],
- };
+ const config = {
+   plugins: {
+     "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
+   },
+ };
```

### 3. Added TailwindCSS Configuration File
**File**: `tailwind.config.ts` (newly created)
- Explicit content paths for file scanning
- Complete color theme configuration matching CSS variables
- TypeScript configuration for better IDE support

## Verification
- ✅ Local build successful: `npm run build`
- ✅ All routes compiled correctly
- ✅ TailwindCSS styles properly processed
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. Trigger a new Vercel deployment
3. Verify the build succeeds on Vercel

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Locked TailwindCSS versions
- `postcss.config.mjs` - Updated plugin configuration
- `src/app/globals.css` - Cleaned up (no functional changes)
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Added explicit configuration (new file)
- `VERCEL_BUILD_FIX.md` - This documentation (new file)

## Key Learnings
- TailwindCSS v4 requires exact version matching between environments
- Vercel's dependency resolution can differ from local npm behavior
- Explicit configuration files improve build consistency across platforms
